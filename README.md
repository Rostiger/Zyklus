# Zyklus
Zyklus is an offline, minimal fertility tracking app that keeps you in control of your data.
It offers an overview of the current cycle phase and (estimated) fertility.

#Usage 
**Use this at your own risk!**
The calendar method is a natural fertility awareness method (FAM).
FAMs niether protect you from Sexually transmited deseases (STDs) nor are they a reliable measure for birth control.   
**Stay safe and use a condom with FAMs to help protect you from pregnancy and STDs.**
