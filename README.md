# Getting Started 
Zyklus is a PWA - a Progressive Web App. Instead of downloading the app from a digital store, all you need to do is to browse to https://rostiger.github.io/zyklus/ with your mobile device and add the website to your Homescreen.

# Backups
The app stores all your data locally on your phone. The advantage is that you don't need to be online to use it and the data doesn't have to be transmitted to servers run by companies you don't know.
The downside is that if your phone gets lost you will also loose all your data. This means, you will want to create backups from time to time.
In the settings section, there is a button to export your data. It will be stored as a plain text file, so make sure to store it in a safe location.

# Misc
Zyklus supports the [Hundred Rabbits Themes](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Themes)
